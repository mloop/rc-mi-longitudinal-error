# Data story

Assume that we have collected pulse wave velocity (PWV) on a set of 2,500 participants at two time points, 5 years apart. However, we used a different machine at the first visit than the second visit. The two machines have known measurement error. Therefore, we will try to build a model that can use both measurements to calculate a valid 5-year difference in PWV.

# Model

Let $Y_1$ be *measured* PWV at visit 1 and $Y_2$ be measured PWV at visit 2. Each of these measurements of PWV is subject to measurement error for the true PWV, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$, at each visit. Assume 
$$
Y_1 \sim N(Z_1, \tau_1)\\
Z_1 \sim N(\mu_1, \sigma)\\
Y_2 \sim N(Z_2, \tau_2)\\
Z_2 \sim N(\mu_2, \sigma)
$$

The estimand of interest is $\theta = \mu_2 - \mu_1$. Based upon the stated model, we have the following assumptions:

1. The measurements of PWV are unbiased for the true values.
2. The measurement error for measuring PWV is different between visit 1 and visit 2.
3. The mean PWV is different between visit 1 and visit 2
4. The variability of true PWV is the same at visit 1 and visit 2.
5. There are 7 parameters to estimate and 4 likelihoods.

Thoughts:

* It might be reasonable to assume that the errors are correlated. In other words, $$corr(Y_1 - Z_1, Y_2 - Z_2) \ne 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

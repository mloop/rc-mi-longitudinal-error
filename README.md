# Calibration of different PWV machines

This project attempts to solve a problem in studies using pulse wave velocity (PWV). In longitudinal studies, the device used to measure PWV can change due to companies going out of business, or simply differences in preference of the principal investigator funding the measurement of PWV. These changes naturally lead to difficulties when trying to compare values of PWV across different devices.

Two existing methods for approaching this problem are: (1) regression calibration; and (2) multiple imputation. However, it is unclear whether one method might be preferred over another.

This *in silico* study found that, generally, multiple imputation with predictive mean matching was the superior approach.
